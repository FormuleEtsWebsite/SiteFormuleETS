        "text": "Formule ETS is a Formula SAE team composed of engineering students from the École de technologie supérieure of Montréal. The Collegiate Design Series competition brings together over 600 universities teams from around the world. They compete by presenting a business plan to judges, describing their vehicle design philosophy, creating a project cost list and of course competing against the best teams in Formula SAE in exciting races. <br/><br/> In the past, we have distinguished ourselves from the competition by repeatedly having the lightest vehicle, demonstrating exemplary vehicle finishing and repeatedly reaching the podium. Formule ETS has been designing electric cars since 2020 and racing cars since 1988."

Thus, we relentlessly pursue the design of the lightest vehicle, year after year. <br/><br/> Our first electric car weights about 195 kg and is powered by four AMK motors located inside of each wheel. MANIC is equipped with 16-inch Hoosier tires mounted on aluminum wheels and brake calipers designed specifically for each wheel.`,

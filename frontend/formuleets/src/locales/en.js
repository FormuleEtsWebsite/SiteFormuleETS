The Collegiate Design Series competitions bring together more than 600 university teams around the world. compete by presenting a business plan to judges, describing their vehicle design philosophy, creating the project cost list and of course competing against top Formula SAE teams in thrilling races. <br > <br> For the first time in over 30 years, the Formula ETS team designs and manufactures its first iteration of an electric car. In the past, we have stood out from the competition by repeatedly having the lightest vehicle in competition, demonstrating an exemplary finish of the vehicle and having repeatedly reached the podium steps in the many competitions in which the team participates.
